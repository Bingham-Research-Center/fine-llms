# Data Preparation for Fine-Tuning

This guide provides a detailed breakdown of how to prepare your research data for fine-tuning a Large Language Model.

### Breaking Down the Data Preparation Process

Here is a more detailed breakdown of how to prepare your research data:

**Step 1.1: Gather Your Raw Materials**

First, gather all the documents you want your AI Research Assistant to learn from. This can include:

*   Research papers (PDFs, Word documents, etc.)
*   Lab notes
*   Presentations
*   Grant proposals
*   Any other documents that contain relevant information

**Step 1.2: Extract the Text**

Next, you need to extract the raw text from these documents. This is a good candidate for automation. You can use Python libraries to extract text from different file formats:

*   **PDFs:** `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber`
*   **Word Documents:** `python-docx`

**Example (using `pdfplumber`):**

```python
import pdfplumber
import os

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ""
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

# Create a directory to store the raw text files
os.makedirs("raw_text", exist_ok=True)

# Loop through your PDF files and extract the text
for filename in os.listdir("your_pdf_directory"):
    if filename.endswith(".pdf"):
        pdf_path = os.path.join("your_pdf_directory", filename)
        text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
        with open(f"raw_text/{filename}.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(text)
```

**Step 1.3: Curate and Clean the Data**

This is the most important step, and it requires manual curation. Raw text extracted from documents can be messy. You need to clean it up and format it in a way that is easy for the model to understand.

**What to look for:**

*   **Remove irrelevant information:** Headers, footers, page numbers, and other formatting artifacts should be removed.
*   **Correct errors:** Look for and correct any errors in the extracted text.
*   **Break down long documents:** Break down long documents into smaller, more manageable chunks. A good rule of thumb is to break them down into paragraphs or sections.

**Step 1.4: Create Your Training Data**

Now it's time to create your `research_data.jsonl` file. As we discussed, it's a good idea to use a mix of different data formats.

*   **Summaries:** Manually write summaries of your research papers. This is a great way to ensure the model learns the key concepts.
*   **Question-Answer Pairs:** This is another manual task, but it's one of the most effective ways to teach your model how to be a helpful assistant. Think about the questions your team members are likely to ask and create a list of questions and answers.
*   **Text Excerpts:** You can also include excerpts of clean, well-formatted text from your papers.

### What to Automate vs. What to Curate

*   **Automate:**
    *   Extracting raw text from documents.
    *   Basic data cleaning tasks, such as removing extra whitespace.
*   **Curate:**
    *   Selecting the most important documents to include in your training data.
    *   Writing summaries and question-answer pairs.
    *   Cleaning and formatting the data to ensure it is high-quality.

### How Much Data is Enough? (And How Much is Too Much?)

This is a common question, and there's no single right answer. It depends on the complexity of your task and the model you are using.

*   **Start small:** For your first fine-tuning job, start with a small, high-quality dataset of **100-500 examples**. This will allow you to get a baseline and test your pipeline without spending too much time or money.
*   **Gradually increase the size:** If you are not satisfied with the performance of your model, you can gradually increase the size of your dataset.
*   **Focus on quality over quantity:** A small, high-quality dataset is better than a large, noisy dataset.
*   **How much is too much?** There is a point of diminishing returns where adding more data does not significantly improve the performance of your model. It's also possible to "overfit" your model if you train it on too much data, especially if the data is not diverse enough.

**Recommendation:** Start with a curated dataset of 100-200 high-quality examples (a mix of summaries and Q&A pairs). This should be enough to get a good sense of what your model is capable of. You can then add more data as needed.
