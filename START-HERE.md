# Quickstart: Fine-Tuning Mistral Models

Welcome to your new project for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)! This guide will provide a basic introduction to fine-tuning, with a specific focus on using Mistral's API. This guide is intended for beginners with a rudimentary knowledge of LLMs and Python.

## What is Fine-Tuning?

In simple terms, fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM (like one of Mistral's base models) and training it further on your own specific dataset. This allows the model to learn and adapt to your specific needs, such as:

*   **Learning a specific knowledge domain:**  You can fine-tune a model on your research papers, and it will learn the terminology, concepts, and writing style of your research group.
*   **Adopting a specific persona or style:** You can train a model to respond in a certain way, for example, as a helpful assistant for your research team.
*   **Performing specific tasks:** You can fine-tune a model to classify text, extract information, or answer questions in a specific format.

For your project, we'll start by fine-tuning a model to understand your research group's cumulative research.

## Fine-Tuning with the Mistral API

Mistral offers a powerful and easy-to-use API for fine-tuning their models. This means you don't need to worry about the complexities of setting up and managing your own training infrastructure. You can simply upload your data, start a fine-tuning job, and Mistral will handle the rest.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

The first and most important step is to prepare your training data. For your goal of training a model on your research, you have a few options:

*   **Full-text papers:** You can use the full text of your research papers. This will give the model the most context, but it can be more expensive and time-consuming to train.
*   **Summaries:** You can use summaries of your papers. This is a good compromise between providing enough context and keeping the training process efficient.
*   **Question-Answer pairs:** You can create a dataset of questions and answers based on your research. This is a great way to create a helpful assistant for your team.

For now, let's start with a simple approach. We'll create a dataset of text excerpts from your research papers.

**Data Format:**

Your data must be in a `.jsonl` file, where each line is a JSON object. For fine-tuning a model to learn your research, you can use a simple text completion format:

```json
{"text": "Your research text excerpt goes here..."}
{"text": "Another excerpt from your research..."}
```

### Step 2: Get Your Mistral API Key

To use the Mistral API, you'll need an API key. You can get one by signing up on the [Mistral website](https://mistral.ai/).

**IMPORTANT: Keep your API key secure!** Do not share it publicly or commit it to your git repository. We will set up a secure way to manage your API key in the next section.

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning with Python

Here's a basic Python script to get you started with fine-tuning using the Mistral API.

```python
import os
from mistralai.client import MistralClient

# It's best practice to store your API key as an environment variable
# to avoid accidentally exposing it in your code.
# You can set this in your terminal like this:
# export MISTRAL_API_KEY='your_api_key'
api_key = os.environ.get("MISTRAL_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable not set")

client = MistralClient(api_key=api_key)

# 1. Upload your training data
with open("your_training_data.jsonl", "rb") as f:
    training_data = client.files.create(file=("your_training_data.jsonl", f))

# 2. Create a fine-tuning job
# For this example, we'll use the open-mistral-7b model
# You can find more information about available models in the Mistral documentation
job = client.jobs.create(
    model="open-mistral-7b",
    training_files=[training_data.id],
    # You can also add validation files to monitor the performance of your model
    # validation_files=[validation_data.id],
)

print(f"Fine-tuning job created with ID: {job.id}")

# You can monitor the status of your job using the following command:
# client.jobs.retrieve(job.id)
```

### Step 4: Using Your Fine-Tuned Model

Once your fine-tuning job is complete, you can use your new model by referencing its fine-tuned model name in your API calls.

## Cost Management and Best Practices

Fine-tuning LLMs can be expensive, so it's important to be mindful of the costs. Here are some tips to keep your costs down:

*   **Start small:** Begin with a small dataset and a small number of training steps to get a baseline.
*   **Use validation data:** Use a validation dataset to monitor the performance of your model and avoid overfitting.
*   **Set a budget:** Mistral allows you to set a budget for your fine-tuning jobs.
*   **Monitor your usage:** Keep an eye on your API usage and costs in the Mistral dashboard.

## Testing

Testing is crucial to ensure your fine-tuned model is performing as expected and to prevent unexpected costs. We will set up a testing framework for this project, but for now, here are some basic testing practices:

*   **Manual testing:** After your model is trained, test it with a variety of prompts to see how it responds.
*   **Create a test set:** Create a separate set of data that your model has not been trained on to evaluate its performance.

This guide provides a starting point for your journey into fine-tuning LLMs. As you and your team become more experienced, we can explore more advanced techniques and build more complex applications.
