# Tutorial: Building Your AI Research Assistant

This tutorial will guide you through the process of fine-tuning a Mistral model to become a "Research Assistant" for your team. We will follow the plan you outlined to create a conversational AI that can understand and discuss your team's research.

## Part 1: The Vision: Your AI Research Assistant

The goal of this project is to create a conversational AI that can act as a knowledgeable assistant for your research team. This AI will be fine-tuned on your team's cumulative research, allowing it to:

*   **Answer questions about your research:** Team members can ask the AI questions about specific papers, experiments, or results, and get answers in plain language.
*   **Summarize research papers:** The AI can provide concise summaries of long and complex research papers.
*   **Brainstorm new ideas:** The AI can help brainstorm new research ideas by connecting concepts from different papers.
*   **Onboard new team members:** The AI can help new team members get up to speed on your team's past research.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working prototype of your AI Research Assistant.

## Part 2: Your Training Data: The Model's "Textbook"

The key to a successful fine-tuning project is high-quality training data. For our AI Research Assistant, we will use a mix of different data formats to give our model a well-rounded understanding of your research.

### Data Formats

*   **Full-Text Papers:** Including the full text of your research papers will give the model the most comprehensive understanding of your work. However, this can be the most expensive and time-consuming approach.
*   **Summaries:** Using summaries of your papers is a good compromise. It provides the model with the key information without the noise of the full text.
*   **Question-Answer Pairs:** This is a great way to teach your model how to answer questions about your research. You can create a list of questions and answers based on your papers.

### Creating Your Dataset

We will create a `.jsonl` file for our training data. Here are examples of how to format each type of data:

```json
{"text": "**From paper X:** [Full text or summary of the paper]"}
{"text": "**Question:** What was the main finding of the 2021 study on topic Y? **Answer:** The main finding was that..."}
```

**Recommendation:** Start with a small, high-quality dataset of summaries and question-answer pairs. You can always add more data later.

## Part 3: The Fine-Tuning Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

This section provides a beginner-friendly walkthrough of the fine-tuning process using the Mistral API and Python. Please refer to the `fine_tune.py` script in the root directory for a complete code example.

1.  **Set up your environment:** Make sure you have Python, the Mistral client, and your API key set up as described in `TUTORIAL.md`.
2.  **Prepare your data:** Create your `research_data.jsonl` file with a mix of summaries and Q&A pairs.
3.  **Upload your data:** Use the `client.files.create()` function to upload your data to Mistral.
4.  **Create a fine-tuning job:** Use the `client.jobs.create()` function to start the fine-tuning job. Make sure to specify the model you want to use (e.g., `open-mistral-7b`).
5.  **Monitor the job:** Use the `client.jobs.retrieve()` function to monitor the status of your job.
6.  **Get your model ID:** Once the job is complete, you will get a new model ID for your fine-tuned model.

## Part 4: Evaluating Your Model: How Good is Your Assistant?

Once your model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance. Here are a few ways to do this:

*   **Manual Testing:** Ask your model a variety of questions about your research and see how it responds. Does it provide accurate and helpful answers?
*   **Create a Test Set:** Create a separate `.jsonl` file with questions and answers that your model has not been trained on. You can then write a script to automatically test your model on this data and measure its accuracy.
*   **Get Feedback from Your Team:** Ask your team to interact with the model and provide feedback. This will help you identify areas where the model needs improvement.

## Part 5: Creative Ideas and Next Steps

Now that you have your AI Research Assistant, here are some creative ideas for how to use it:

*   **Integrate it with Slack:** Create a Slack bot that allows your team to interact with the model directly in your team's workspace.
*   **Build a web interface:** Create a simple web interface that allows your team to chat with the model.
*   **Connect it to other tools:** Connect your model to other tools, such as a reference manager or a note-taking app.

As for next steps, you can continue to improve your model by:

*   **Adding more data:** The more high-quality data you provide, the better your model will perform.
*   **Experimenting with different hyperparameters:** You can experiment with different learning rates, training steps, and other hyperparameters to improve your model's performance.
*   **Trying different models:** You can try fine-tuning different Mistral models to see which one works best for your needs.

## Part 6: "Gotchas" and Best Practices

Here are some common pitfalls to avoid and best practices to follow:

*   **Don't overfit your model:** Overfitting happens when your model learns your training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. To avoid this, use a validation set and monitor your model's performance.
*   **Start small:** Don't try to boil the ocean. Start with a small, manageable project and then build on it over time.
*   **Be mindful of costs:** Fine-tuning can be expensive. Make sure to set a budget and monitor your costs closely.
*   **Iterate, iterate, iterate:** The key to a successful fine-tuning project is to iterate. Don't be afraid to experiment with different data, models, and hyperparameters.

We hope this tutorial has been helpful. Happy fine-tuning!
