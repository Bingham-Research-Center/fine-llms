# Tutorial: Building Your AI Research Assistant

This tutorial will guide you through the process of fine-tuning a Mistral model to become a "Research Assistant" for your team. We will follow the plan you outlined to create a conversational AI that can understand and discuss your team's research.

## Part 1: The Vision: Your AI Research Assistant

The goal of this project is to create a conversational AI that can act as a knowledgeable assistant for your research team. This AI will be fine-tuned on your team's cumulative research, allowing it to:

*   **Answer questions about your research:** Team members can ask the AI questions about specific papers, experiments, or results, and get answers in plain language.
*   **Summarize research papers:** The AI can provide concise summaries of long and complex research papers.
*   **Brainstorm new ideas:** The AI can help brainstorm new research ideas by connecting concepts from different papers.
*   **Onboard new team members:** The AI can help new team members get up to speed on your team's past research.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working prototype of your AI Research Assistant.

## Part 2: Your Training Data: The Model's "Textbook"

The key to a successful fine-tuning project is high-quality training data. For our AI Research Assistant, we will use a mix of different data formats to give our model a well-rounded understanding of your research.

### Data Formats

*   **Full-Text Papers:** Including the full text of your research papers will give the model the most comprehensive understanding of your work. However, this can be the most expensive and time-consuming approach.
*   **Summaries:** Using summaries of your papers is a good compromise. It provides the model with the key information without the noise of the full text.
*   **Question-Answer Pairs:** This is a great way to teach your model how to answer questions about your research. You can create a list of questions and answers based on your papers.

### Creating Your Dataset

We will create a `.jsonl` file for our training data. You can create your Q&A pairs in the `reference-text/Q-A-DRAFT.md` file and then use the `convert_to_jsonl.py` script to convert them to the required format.

## Part 3: The Fine-Tuning Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

This section provides a beginner-friendly walkthrough of the fine-tuning process using the Mistral API and Python.

1.  **Set up your environment:** Make sure you have Python and have installed the required packages from `requirements.txt`.
2.  **Prepare your data:** Make sure your `reference-text/Q-A-DRAFT.md` file is up-to-date with your human-vetted Q&A pairs.
3.  **Convert your data:** Run the `convert_to_jsonl.py` script to convert your Markdown Q&A pairs to the required JSONL format:

    ```bash
    python convert_to_jsonl.py
    ```

4.  **Create a fine-tuning job:** Run the `scripts/fine_tune.py` script to upload your data and create the fine-tuning job:

    ```bash
    python scripts/fine_tune.py
    ```

5.  **Start the job:** The script will create the job but will not start it automatically. You will need to go to the Mistral website to review the job and manually start the training process.

## Part 4: Evaluating Your Model: How Good is Your Assistant?

Once your model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance. Here are a few ways to do this:

*   **Manual Testing:** Ask your model a variety of questions about your research and see how it responds. Does it provide accurate and helpful answers?
*   **Create a Test Set:** Create a separate `.jsonl` file with questions and answers that your model has not been trained on. You can then write a script to automatically test your model on this data and measure its accuracy.
*   **Get Feedback from Your Team:** Ask your team to interact with the model and provide feedback. This will help you identify areas where the model needs improvement.

## Part 5: Creative Ideas and Next Steps

Now that you have your AI Research Assistant, here are some creative ideas for how to use it:

*   **Integrate it with Slack:** Create a Slack bot that allows your team to interact with the model directly in your team's workspace.
*   **Build a web interface:** Create a simple web interface that allows your team to chat with the model.
*   **Connect it to other tools:** Connect your model to other tools, such as a reference manager or a note-taking app.

As for next steps, you can continue to improve your model by:

*   **Adding more data:** The more high-quality data you provide, the better your model will perform.
*   **Experimenting with different hyperparameters:** You can experiment with different learning rates, training steps, and other hyperparameters to improve your model's performance.
*   **Trying different models:** You can try fine-tuning different Mistral models to see which one works best for your needs.

## Part 6: "Gotchas" and Best Practices

Here are some common pitfalls to avoid and best practices to follow:

*   **Don't overfit your model:** Overfitting happens when your model learns your training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. To avoid this, use a validation set and monitor your model's performance.
*   **Start small:** Don't try to boil the ocean. Start with a small, manageable project and then build on it over time.
*   **Be mindful of costs:** Fine-tuning can be expensive. Make sure to set a budget and monitor your costs closely.
*   **Iterate, iterate, iterate:** The key to a successful fine-tuning project is to iterate. Don't be afraid to experiment with different data, models, and hyperparameters.

We hope this tutorial has been helpful. Happy fine-tuning!
