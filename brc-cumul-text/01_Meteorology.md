# Meteorology of the Uinta Basin

This document summarizes the key meteorological factors that contribute to air quality issues in the Uinta Basin, with a focus on winter ozone formation.

## Key Components of Ozone-forming Winter Inversions

Significant local ozone production during wintertime requires the following three ingredients:

*   **Thermal inversions:** When not inverted, the atmosphere is well mixed and ozone precursors are rapidly dispersed.
*   **Snow cover:** The snow surface reflects rather than absorbs solar radiation, the energy source for ozone formation. This increases the amount of radiation available in the atmosphere for chemical reactions. Snow cover also acts to stabilize inversions by reflecting sunlight and keeping the surface cool.
*   **Precursor emissions:** Only organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced by the oil and gas industry, as opposed to typical urban sources, appear to be capable of generating significant winter ozone.

### Winter Ozone in Other Regions

*   The only known regions to produce winter ozone are the Uintah Basin and the Upper Green River Basin (near Pinedale, Wyoming), both of which have a robust oil and natural gas industry.
*   The absence of winter ozone in other basins with inversions and snow cover suggests that precursors from the oil and gas industry are required.
*   The Wind River Basin has all three ingredients but less than half the oil and gas activity of the Uinta Basin. It is predicted that winter ozone will occur there if the petroleum industry grows.
*   A rare winter ozone event in the Denver area was linked to oil and gas emissions.

## Inversion Structure, Extent, and Frequency

*   A thermal inversion occurs when surface air is colder than the air aloft.
*   Wintertime ozone formation requires inversion conditions that last more than 24 hours.
*   The “bowl-shaped” terrain of the Uinta Basin is ideal for strong inversion layers to build up and persist.
*   Low winds with upslope flow during the day and downslope flow during the night are typical during winter inversions.
*   The inversion top is flat, rather than following elevation contours.
*   Inversion events are complex and can have changing lapse rates, changing inversion depth, and sometimes ice fog.
*   Inversions tend to form first at the lowest elevations and then build out and up as the episode continues.
*   The frequency and duration of inversions are larger in winter and are correlated with the presence of snow cover.
*   December and January are the worst months for inversions, but ozone concentrations are higher in February due to increased sunlight.
