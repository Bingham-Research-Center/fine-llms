# Methane Emissions in the Uinta Basin

This document summarizes research findings related to methane emissions in the Uinta Basin.

## Basin-wide Methane Emissions Estimates

Estimates of Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions vary widely between studies and methodologies:

*   **Karion et al. (2013):** 55.0 (24-85) Mg/hr for winter 2012 (aircraft-based mass balance).
*   **Alvarez et al. (2018):** 29.0 Mg/hr for 2015 (multiple field observations).
*   **Foster et al. (2017a):** ~55 Mg/hr for spring 2015/2016 (inverse modeling).
*   **Shen et al. (2022):** 7.6 Mg/hr for 2018 (EPA/ECCC inventory) and 11.0 Mg/hr for 2018-2020 (TROPOMI satellite).
*   **Lu et al. (2023):** 10.8 (9.2-11.9) Mg/hr from 2010-2019 (GOSAT satellite) and 6.8 (6.7-8.4) Mg/hr from 2018-2019 (TROPOMI satellite).
*   **Cusworth et al. (2022):** 30.8 ± 5.0 Mg/hr in summer 2020 (TROPOMI satellite).
*   **Sherwin et al. (2024):** 18 (17-20) Mg/hr in summer 2020 (aerial measurements).
*   **Williams et al. (2024):** 11 (9-19) Mg/hr in 2021 (facility-level measurements).
*   **Omara et al. (2024):** 12.7 Mg/hr in 2021 (ground-based measurements) and 15.0 Mg/hr in August 2021 (aircraft-based MethaneAir).
*   **MethaneSAT (2024):** 35 Mg/hr in Summer/Fall 2023 (aircraft-based MethaneAir).

## Methane and Organic Compound Emissions

### General Information

*   Emissions of organics are more likely to be detectable at new, high-producing oil and gas wells.
*   Cold weather leads to poor performance by optical gas imaging cameras, making leak detection and repair less likely in winter.
*   Electrification of oil and gas facilities has the potential to reduce emissions.

### Production-normalized Methane Emissions

*   Methane emissions per well pad in the Uinta Basin are the third highest in a study of eight oil and gas-producing basins.
*   Methane emissions normalized by natural gas production were highest in the Uinta Basin.
*   The high number of low-producing wells may contribute to the high production-normalized emissions.
*   The prevalence of oil versus gas production in the Uinta Basin may also contribute to the high methane emissions as a percentage of production.

### Other Methane Emissions Information

*   Methane emissions from liquids unloadings are a small part of total methane emissions.
*   The buildup of methane during inversion episodes has been detected from space.
*   About 90% of methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are from sources that emit less than 200 kg/hr.
*   85 ± 7% of methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are from oil and gas sources.
*   Marginal wells are responsible for a significant portion of methane emissions.
