# NOx and Organic Compound Emissions

This document summarizes research findings related to NOx and organic compound emissions in the Uinta Basin.

## Non-methane Organic Compounds

*   The Utah Division of Air Quality's 2017 oil and gas inventory is roughly accurate for total Basin-wide non-methane organics emissions, but it underestimates methanol and aromatics emissions and incorrectly allocates emissions to individual source types.

## Formaldehyde and other Carbonyls

*   Nearly 100% of formaldehyde in the Uinta Basin atmosphere is formed secondarily (from chemical reactions in the atmosphere).
*   Direct emissions of formaldehyde are estimated to be 9-10 kg/hr for 2018-2020.

## NOx Emissions

*   NOx emissions were estimated to be 0.21, 0.26, and 0.25 Mg/hr for 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, using TROPOMI satellite data.
*   The FOG inventory estimated NOx emissions to be 0.32, 0.26, and 0.19 for the same years.

## Multi-pollutant Temporal Trends

*   Emissions of NOx and methane have declined along with wintertime ozone from about 2013 through 2021.
*   This decline is likely due to a decrease in natural gas production and improvements to industry operations.
*   Methane and non-methane organics emissions tend to track changes in gas production, but not oil production.

## Engines

*   Inventories have assumed much higher NOx emissions and much lower organic compound emissions from pumpjack engines than occurs in reality.
*   Real-world pumpjack engines in the Uinta Basin run extremely lean, leading to less NOx formation and less complete combustion.

## Produced Water

*   Organic compound emissions from produced water ponds are around 4% to 14% of inventoried organic compounds.
*   Emissions from produced water ponds are more reactive than typical oil and gas emissions and are responsible for 18-35% of locally-produced ozone.

## Subsurface Leaks

*   Ozone-forming organic compounds can leak from subsurface infrastructure at well pads, but they make a very small contribution to total emissions.

## Liquid Storage Tanks

*   The majority of fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells come from thief hatches and pressure relief valves on tanks.
*   Well pads with emissions control devices are more likely to have detectable emissions from tanks, indicating that organics are escaping before they can reach the control devices.
