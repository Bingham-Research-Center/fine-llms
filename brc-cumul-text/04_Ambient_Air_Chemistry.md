# Ambient Air Chemistry in the Uinta Basin

This document summarizes research findings related to ambient air chemistry in the Uinta Basin, with a focus on winter ozone formation.

## Ozone

*   Ozone during winter inversions is formed in the same way as urban, summertime ozone, but the source of radicals is different.
*   Radical production is dominated by the photolysis of aldehydes in the atmosphere.
*   Wintertime ozone concentrations are spatially correlated with elevation and proximity to oil and gas wells.
*   Ozone production is more efficient for inversion episodes that occur further away from the winter solstice.
*   Wintertime ozone concentrations in the Uinta Basin decreased between about 2013 and 2021.

### Summertime Ozone

*   Exceedances of the ozone standard during the summer are usually due to events separate from local anthropogenic emission sources, such as wildfire smoke and stratospheric intrusions.

### Impact of NOx versus Organic Compound Emissions

*   Both organic compound and NOx emission controls would have been effective at reducing winter ozone in 2013, but NOx controls would have been more effective.
*   NOx controls become increasingly effective as the year progresses away from the winter solstice.
*   The difference in air chemistry between the Salt Lake Valley (high PM) and the Uinta Basin (high ozone) is due to dramatically different emission profiles.

## Organic Compounds

*   The relative concentrations of individual organic compounds in the Uinta Basin atmosphere are similar to the speciation of natural gas, indicating that the primary source is oil and gas production.
*   The spatial distribution of organic compounds is strongly correlated with the distribution of oil and gas wells.
*   Emissions from oil wells are richer in heavier organics relative to gas wells.
*   Concentrations of organic compounds increase during inversion episodes.
*   Less-reactive light alkanes are more abundant in the atmosphere and are responsible for a larger percentage of ozone production than more reactive aromatic compounds.

## Reactive Nitrogen

*   Nitrous acid (HONO) photolysis is not a major source of radicals.
*   The highest concentrations of NOx are found in populated areas.
*   Unlike organic compounds, NOx concentrations donâ€™t tend to increase under inversion episodes.
*   Nighttime N2O5 formation is the most important removal process for NOx.
*   Peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) and nitric acid are the most abundant non-NOx reactive nitrogen species during inversion episodes.

## Particulate Matter

*   Particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations increase during winter inversion episodes, but the Uinta Basin is not in danger of exceeding EPA standards for particulate matter.
*   The largest component of particulate matter in some parts of the Uinta Basin is organic compounds.
