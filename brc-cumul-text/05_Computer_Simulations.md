# Computer Simulations of Uinta Basin Air Quality

This document summarizes research findings related to computer simulations of meteorology and air chemistry in the Uinta Basin.

## Meteorological Simulations

*   Three-dimensional simulations of meteorology are required inputs to photochemical air quality models.
*   State-of-the-art meteorological models (e.g., WRF) are not able to accurately reproduce all the characteristics of inversion layers in the Uinta Basin.
*   Meteorological models tend to produce warm temperature biases, overpredict warm clouds, underpredict ice clouds, overpredict inversion depth, and underpredict inversion strengths.
*   Standard meteorological models poorly represent surface characteristics during winter inversions.
*   Data assimilation using satellite-based data can improve photochemical model performance.
*   Applying observational four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) (or nudging) in meteorological simulations improves model performance.

## Air Chemistry Simulations

*   High ozone episodes that occurred during winter 2013 have been the focus of most photochemical modeling efforts to date.
*   Different modeling platforms have been used, including CMAQ, CAMx, and WRF-Chem.

### Emissions in Photochemical Models

*   Discrepancies in emission inventories (overestimation of NOx, underestimation of organic compounds) are a major reason for negative biases in predicted ozone concentrations.
*   Researchers have scaled up organic compound emissions or scaled up organic compound emissions and scaled down NOx emissions to obtain simulated ozone concentrations closer to observed values.
*   It is also possible that inadequate representation of meteorological conditions is responsible for poor model performance.
*   Increasing the proportion of formaldehyde in emissions inventories, rather than increasing the total amount of organic compound emissions, was enough to bring the predicted ozone in line with observed values in some studies.

### Impact of Chemical Mechanism on Model Performance

*   The majority of modeling studies in the Uinta Basin have utilized the Carbon Bond chemical mechanism version 5 (CB05) in CMAQ.
*   The CB6 and SAPRC07 mechanisms have been updated for winter conditions in the Uinta Basin.
*   Modeling studies that compare CMAQ model performance using CB6 over CB05 are still limited.
