# Mistral Training Strategies for Scientific Corpora

This document outlines advanced fine-tuning strategies beyond basic Q&A to create a more capable and versatile model using a specialized corpus like the Uinta Basin air quality research.

## 1. Abstractive Summarization

- **Concept:** Train the model to generate concise, original summaries of long text passages or entire documents.
- **Training Data:** `{"input": "<long text>", "output": "<human-written summary>"}`
- **Pros:**
    - **High Utility:** Enables rapid digestion of dense research.
    - **Teaches Synthesis:** Forces the model to understand concepts, not just copy sentences.
- **Cons:**
    - **Labor-Intensive:** Creating high-quality summaries is difficult.
    - **Risk of Inaccuracy:** Nuance can be lost during simplification.

## 2. Text Simplification (ELI5)

- **Concept:** Train the model to translate technical jargon into plain, accessible language.
- **Training Data:** `{"input": "<technical paragraph>", "output": "<simple explanation>"}`
- **Pros:**
    - **Builds Deeper Understanding:** Requires the model to grasp underlying principles.
    - **Broadens Audience:** Makes research accessible to non-experts.
- **Cons:**
    - **Expertise Required:** Needs a subject matter expert who is also a skilled communicator.
    - **Risk of Oversimplification:** Easy to lose critical details or introduce subtle errors.

## 3. Structured Data Extraction

- **Concept:** Train the model to extract specific data points from unstructured text and format them into a structured format (e.g., JSON, Markdown table).
- **Training Data:** `{"instruction": "Extract methane emission estimates into a JSON array.", "input": "<text with data points>", "output": "[{"value": 55.0, "unit": "Mg/hr", ...}]"}`
- **Pros:**
    - **Turns Documents into Databases:** Extremely powerful for data analysis and integration.
    - **Teaches Precision:** Model learns to find exact figures, units, and context.
- **Cons:**
    - **Brittle:** May fail if text formatting deviates from training examples.
    - **Tedious Data Creation:** Defining a schema and annotating data is meticulous work.

## 4. Claim & Evidence Mapping

- **Concept:** Train the model to connect scientific claims to their cited sources within the text.
- **Training Data:** `{"instruction": "What claim does (Mansfield and Hall, 2018) support?", "input": "<paragraph with citation>", "output": "<The specific claim>"}`
- **Pros:**
    - **Combats Hallucination:** Grounds the model's knowledge in textual evidence.
    - **Enables Fact-Checking:** Creates a foundation for a trustworthy, source-citing assistant.
- **Cons:**
    - **Complex Relationships:** The link between a claim and citation can be subtle and span multiple sentences.

## 5. Full-Text Domain Adaptation (Unsupervised)

- **Concept:** A foundational step where the base model's training is continued on the raw text of the entire corpus (e.g., hundreds of full-text papers). The model's objective is simply to learn to predict the next word.
- **Training Data:** A single, large text file of all source material. No labels or instructions needed.
- **Pros:**
    - **Deep Domain Fluency:** The most effective way to teach the model the specific vocabulary, jargon, and sentence structures of a specialized field.
    - **No Manual Labeling:** Fully unsupervised, saving immense human effort.
- **Cons:**
    - **Computationally Expensive:** This is continued pre-training, not simple fine-tuning, and requires significant resources.
    - **Not a Task-Specific Skill:** This step makes the model a better *base* for other tasks but doesn't teach it to follow instructions on its own. It's a preliminary step before instruction tuning.

## Recommended Approach

For a comprehensive model, a hybrid strategy is most effective:
1.  **Domain Adaptation (Optional but powerful):** If resources permit, start with unsupervised full-text adaptation to make the model "fluent" in the scientific domain.
2.  **Multi-Task Instruction Tuning:** Fine-tune the domain-adapted model on a mixture of tasks, such as **Q&A**, **Summarization**, and **Structured Data Extraction**, to build a versatile and highly capable scientific assistant.
