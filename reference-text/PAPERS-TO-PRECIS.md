(Lyman and Tran, 2015)

*   **Main Finding:** The "bowl-shaped" terrain of the Uinta Basin creates ideal conditions for strong, persistent temperature inversions.
*   **Applicability:** This paper is fundamental to understanding the meteorological conditions that lead to winter ozone events in the Uinta Basin.

(Mansfield, 2017)

*   **Main Finding:** December and January are the worst months for inversions, but ozone concentrations are higher in February due to increased sunlight.
*   **Applicability:** This paper helps explain the seasonal dynamics of winter ozone formation.

(Mansfield and Hall, 2013)

*   **Main Finding:** Air temperature measurements from surface sites at different elevations can be used to determine the strength of thermal inversions.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides a methodology for identifying and characterizing winter inversions.

(Mansfield and Hall, 2018)

*   **Main Finding:** The only known regions to produce winter ozone are the Uintah Basin and the Upper Green River Basin, both of which have a robust oil and natural gas industry.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides strong evidence that emissions from the oil and gas industry are a necessary ingredient for winter ozone formation.

(Oltmans et al., 2014)

*   **Main Finding:** Winter ozone is associated with oil and natural gas extraction activity in Wyoming and Utah.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides further evidence for the link between oil and gas activity and winter ozone.

(Schnell et al., 2009)

*   **Main Finding:** Rapid photochemical production of ozone can occur at high concentrations in a rural site during winter.
*   **Applicability:** This was one of the first papers to document the phenomenon of winter ozone formation in a rural, oil and gas producing region.

(Langford et al., 2024, EGUsphere)

*   **Main Finding:** A rare winter ozone event in the Denver area was linked to oil and gas emissions.
*   **Applicability:** This paper shows that winter ozone formation is not limited to the Uinta Basin and can occur in other areas with significant oil and gas activity.

(Schnell et al., 2016, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres)

*   **Main Finding:** The inversion top in the Uinta Basin is flat, rather than following elevation contours.
*   **Applicability:** This finding is important for understanding the vertical structure of inversions and how pollutants are transported within them.

(Neemann et al., 2015, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics)

*   **Main Finding:** Winter inversion events are complex, with changing lapse rates, changing inversion depth, and sometimes ice fog.
*   **Applicability:** This paper highlights the challenges of accurately modeling winter inversions.

(Tran et al., 2018, Atmospheric Environment)

*   **Main Finding:** Applying observational four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) in meteorological simulations improves model performance in simulating inversion layer structure.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides a method for improving the accuracy of meteorological models used to simulate winter ozone events.

(Karion et al., 2013, Geophysical Research Letters)

*   **Main Finding:** Estimated Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions to be 55.0 (between 24 and 85) Mg/hr for winter 2012 via aircraft-based mass balance.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides one of the first estimates of methane emissions from the Uinta Basin.

(Alvarez et al., 2018, Science)

*   **Main Finding:** Estimated Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions to be 29.0 Mg/hr for 2015 via multiple field observations.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides a more recent estimate of methane emissions and highlights the variability in emissions estimates.

(Foster et al., 2017a, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres)

*   **Main Finding:** Estimated Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions to be ~55 Mg/hr for spring 2015 and spring 2016 via an inverse modeling technique.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides another estimate of methane emissions and demonstrates the use of inverse modeling techniques.

(Foster et al., 2019, Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene)

*   **Main Finding:** Estimated Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions to be 44.6 ± 9.7 and 61.8 ± 19.8 Mg/hr for two different inversion episodes during winter 2015-16.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides estimates of methane emissions during specific inversion episodes.

(Shen et al., 2022, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics)

*   **Main Finding:** Estimated Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions to be 7.6 Mg/hr for 2018 in the EPA/ECCC inventory and 11.0 Mg/hr for May 2018 to February 2020 via TROPOMI satellite-based emissions inversion.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides lower estimates of methane emissions and highlights the potential for satellite-based methods.

(Lu et al., 2023, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)

*   **Main Finding:** Observed a decreasing trend in oil and gas production in the Uinta Basin of 4% per year from 2010 to 2019.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides important information about trends in oil and gas activity in the Uinta Basin.

(Cusworth et al., 2022, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)

*   **Main Finding:** 18% of methane emissions were attributable to large point sources.
*   **Applicability:** This paper highlights the importance of large point sources in total methane emissions.

(Sherwin et al., 2024, Nature)

*   **Main Finding:** Estimated a methane loss rate of 5.74% for 2020.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides a recent estimate of the methane loss rate from oil and gas operations in the Uinta Basin.

(Williams et al., 2024, EGUsphere)

*   **Main Finding:** About 90% of methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are from sources that emit less than 200 kg/hr.
*   **Applicability:** This paper highlights the importance of small, numerous sources of methane emissions.

(Omara et al., 2024, Earth System Science Data)

*   **Main Finding:** Constructed a measurement-based spatially explicit inventory of US oil and gas methane emissions for 2021.
*   **Applicability:** This paper provides a new, detailed inventory of methane emissions.
