**Question:** What are the three key ingredients for winter ozone formation in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** Significant local ozone production during wintertime requires three ingredients: thermal inversions, snow cover, and precursor emissions from the oil and gas industry.

---
---

**Question:** Why is snow cover important for winter ozone formation?

**Answer:** The snow surface reflects rather than absorbs solar radiation, the energy source for ozone formation. This increases the amount of radiation available in the atmosphere for chemical reactions. Snow cover also acts to stabilize inversions by reflecting sunlight and keeping the surface cool.

---
---

**Question:** What is the role of thermal inversions in winter ozone?

**Answer:** When the atmosphere is not inverted, it is well mixed and ozone precursors are rapidly dispersed. Thermal inversions trap pollutants near the surface, allowing them to build up to concentrations high enough for ozone formation to occur.

---
---

**Question:** Are urban sources of pollution capable of generating significant winter ozone?

**Answer:** No, only organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced by the oil and gas industry appear to be capable of generating significant winter ozone.

---
---

**Question:** What other regions besides the Uinta Basin produce winter ozone?

**Answer:** The only other known region to produce winter ozone is the Upper Green River Basin (near Pinedale, Wyoming), which also has a robust oil and natural gas industry.

---
---

**Question:** Why doesn't the Wind River Basin produce winter ozone, even though it has all the necessary ingredients?

**Answer:** Gas and oil activity in the Wind River Basin are less than half that of the Uinta Basin. It is predicted that winter ozone will probably occur there if the petroleum industry grows.

---
---

**Question:** How is the inversion structure in the Uinta Basin measured?

**Answer:** Tethersonde measurements of inversion strength do not occur routinely, so air temperature measurements at a number of different surface sites at different elevations throughout the basin are used to make this determination.

---
---

**Question:** How long do wintertime inversion episodes typically last?

**Answer:** Multi-day inversion episodes have occurred for as short as two days, and for more than two weeks.

---
---

**Question:** What is the typical wind pattern during a winter inversion?

**Answer:** Low winds with upslope flow during the day and downslope flow during the night are typical during winter inversions.

---
---

**Question:** Is the top of the inversion layer flat or does it follow the terrain?

**Answer:** Available evidence suggests that the inversion top is flat, rather than following elevation contours.

---
---

**Question:** How do inversions end?

**Answer:** The inversion episode ends when a storm breaks up the inversion structure and mixes out the polluted air. This process tends to clear out the highest elevations and the basin margins first, and weak storms sometimes fail to entirely eliminate inversion conditions at the lowest elevations.

---
---

**Question:** Which months are the worst for inversions, and which months have the highest ozone concentrations?

**Answer:** By most measures, December and January are the worst months for inversions, but on average, ozone concentrations are higher in February. This occurs because the lower solar zenith angle and the lengthening day in February provide more sunlight for ozone production.

---
---

**Question:** What were the estimated methane emissions in the Uinta Basin in 2012?

**Answer:** Uinta Basin-wide methane emissions have been estimated to be 55.0 (between 24 and 85) Mg/hr for winter 2012 via aircraft-based mass balance (Karion et al., 2013).

---
---

**Question:** How have methane emissions in the Uinta Basin changed over time?

**Answer:** Emissions of NOx and methane have declined along with wintertime ozone, especially in the eastern Uinta Basin, from about 2013 through 2021. This decline appears to be due to a strong decline in natural gas production in the eastern Basin, and improvements to industry operations that have decreased emissions.

---
---

**Question:** What is the primary source of formaldehyde in the Uinta Basin atmosphere?

**Answer:** A March-April 2015 aircraft study and subsequent modeling and analysis found that nearly 100% of formaldehyde in the Uinta Basin atmosphere was formed secondarily (i.e., from chemical reactions in the atmosphere, rather than emitted directly from sources).

---
---

**Question:** How have NOx emissions in the Uinta Basin changed over time?

**Answer:** Emissions of NOx and methane have declined along with wintertime ozone, especially in the eastern Uinta Basin, from about 2013 through 2021.

---
---

**Question:** What is the relationship between natural gas production and methane emissions?

**Answer:** Methane and non-methane organics emissions tend to track changes in gas production, but not oil production.

---
---

**Question:** What is the impact of cold weather on the detection of organic gas leaks?

**Answer:** Cold weather leads to poor performance by the optical gas imaging cameras that many operators use to detect and repair organic gas leaks at well pads. Thus, leaks are less likely to be detected and repaired during winter.

---
---

**Question:** How does electrification of oil and gas facilities impact emissions?

**Answer:** Electrification of oil and natural gas facilities has the potential to reduce emissions of organic compounds and NOX from several oil and gas sources, including engines, separators, heaters, pneumatic controllers and pumps, storage tanks, drilling, and completions.

---
---

**Question:** Are biogenic emissions a significant source of organic compounds in the winter?

**Answer:** Biogenic emissions of organic compounds are unimportant to ozone production during Uinta Basin winters.

---
---

**Question:** What are the main sources of organic compound emissions from produced water ponds?

**Answer:** Emissions from produced water ponds include light hydrocarbons, methanol, aromatics (BTEX), and carbon dioxide.

---
---

**Question:** How do emissions from produced water ponds contribute to ozone formation?

**Answer:** The composition of organic compound emissions from produced water is more reactive than typical oil and gas emissions, meaning that a given quantity of emitted organics is more able to produce ozone than the same quantity of typical oil and gas emissions. When added to the 2014 multi-agency oil and gas inventory for the Uinta Basin, emissions from produced water ponds are responsible for 18-35% of locally-produced ozone.

---
---

**Question:** Are subsurface leaks from well pads a major source of emissions?

**Answer:** No, ozone-forming organic compounds can leak from subsurface infrastructure at well pads, but they make a very small contribution to total emissions from the oil and gas industry.

---
---

**Question:** What is the primary source of fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells?

**Answer:** The majority of fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells, including oil and gas wells with emission control devices, come from thief hatches and pressure relief valves on tanks.

---
---

**Question:** Why do pumpjack engines in the Uinta Basin emit less NOx than expected?

**Answer:** Real-world pumpjack engines in the Uinta Basin run extremely lean, meaning that they take in much more air than is needed for combustion. This leads to cooler conditions, which allows for less NOX formation and less complete combustion.

---
---

**Question:** What is the main source of radicals for ozone formation in the winter?

**Answer:** During cold winter months, the atmosphere holds less water vapor, and the main source of radicals (OH radical from reactions between water vapor and oxygen atoms) is curtailed. Instead, radical production is dominated by the photolysis of aldehydes in the atmosphere.

---
---

**Question:** How does the timing of an inversion episode (e.g., January vs. March) impact ozone production?

**Answer:** Ozone production is more efficient for inversion episodes that occur further away from the winter solstice. This means that, for a given level of precursor pollutants, ozone is produced much more quickly in February and March than in December and January.

---
---

**Question:** What is the difference in air chemistry between the Salt Lake Valley and the Uinta Basin during winter inversions?

**Answer:** In the Salt Lake Valley, wintertime inversion episodes result in high concentrations of particulate matter, not ozone. The reason for the difference in air chemistry in the two areas is dramatically different emission profiles. In the Salt Lake area, emissions of NOx are plentiful and organic compound emissions are relatively few. The opposite is the case in the Uinta Basin.

---
---

**Question:** Is ozone formation in the Uinta Basin more sensitive to NOx or VOC emissions?

**Answer:** Both organic compound and NOx emission controls would have been effective at reducing Uinta Basin winter ozone in 2013, though NOx controls would have been more effective. NOx controls become increasingly effective (relative to organic compound controls) as the year progresses away from the winter solstice.

---
---

**Question:** What are the most abundant organic compounds in the Uinta Basin atmosphere?

**Answer:** Even though aromatic compounds are more reactive, less-reactive light alkanes (including propane, butanes, and pentanes) are much more abundant in the atmosphere and are responsible for a larger percentage of ozone production.

---
---

**Question:** What is the primary source of reactive nitrogen in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** The highest concentrations of NOx are found in the populated areas of the Uinta Basin.

---
---

**Question:** Do NOx concentrations increase during inversion episodes?

**Answer:** Unlike organic compounds, NOx concentrations don’t tend to increase under inversion episodes, relative to inversion-free periods.

---
---

**Question:** What are the most abundant non-NOx reactive nitrogen species during inversion episodes?

**Answer:** Peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) and nitric acid are the most abundant non-NOx reactive nitrogen species (i.e., NOZ) during inversion episodes.

---
---

**Question:** Are particulate matter concentrations in the Uinta Basin a major health concern?

**Answer:** Particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations increase above background levels during winter inversion episodes in the Uinta Basin, but the Uinta Basin is not in danger of exceeding EPA standards for particulate matter.

---
---

**Question:** What is the largest component of particulate matter in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** The largest component of particulate matter in some parts of the Uinta Basin is organic compounds. This is true in populated areas and in oil and gas producing areas.

---
---

**Question:** Why do meteorological models have difficulty simulating winter inversions in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** State-of-the-art three-dimensional meteorological models (e.g., Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)) were not designed to simulate the micro-scale physical processes that impact inversion layers in complex terrain.

---
---

**Question:** What are some of the common inaccuracies in meteorological models of the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** Meteorological models tend to produce warm temperature biases, overpredict warm clouds, underpredict ice clouds, overpredict inversion depth, and underpredict inversion strengths.

---
---

**Question:** How can data assimilation be used to improve meteorological models?

**Answer:** Data assimilation using satellite-based data can improve photochemical model performance. Applying observational four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) (or nudging) in meteorological simulations also improves model performance.

---
---

**Question:** What is the main reason that photochemical models have difficulty simulating winter ozone formation?

**Answer:** Many photochemical modeling studies suggest that discrepancies in emission inventories, including overestimation of NOx emissions and underestimation of organic compound emissions, are one of the major reasons for negative biases in predicted ozone concentrations.

---
---

**Question:** How have researchers adjusted emissions inventories to improve the accuracy of photochemical models?

**Answer:** To obtain simulated ozone concentrations closer to observed values, researchers have scaled up organic compound emissions or scaled up organic compound emissions and scaled down NOx emissions.

---
---

**Question:** What is the impact of the chemical mechanism (e.g., CB05 vs. CB6) on the performance of photochemical models?

**Answer:** The choice of chemical mechanism can impact the predicted ozone concentrations. For example, the CB6 mechanism can produce lower ozone concentrations than the CB05 mechanism due to its updates to organic nitrate production.

---
---

**Question:** How can regression models be used to forecast winter ozone?

**Answer:** Regression models can be used with meteorological forecast data to make a forecast of ozone concentration 24 to 48 hours in advance. They can also be used in “hindcast” mode to make statistical estimates about the modern ozone system.

---
---

**Question:** What are the health impacts of ozone?

**Answer:** Ozone negatively impacts respiratory health. Children, the elderly, and those with respiratory diseases are most vulnerable.

---
---

**Question:** Is there a correlation between asthma cases and ozone concentrations in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** A study of asthma cases at a Uinta Basin hospital did not find a correlation with ozone concentrations, probably because of the small population size and the confounding influence of other triggers of asthma attacks.

---
---

**Question:** Are there adverse birth outcomes associated with air quality in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** Adverse birth outcomes do not occur at a greater frequency in the Uinta Basin compared to the rest of the state.

---
---

**Question:** What are the concentrations of benzene in Roosevelt, and how do they compare to other urban areas?

**Answer:** Concentrations of benzene in Roosevelt are higher than thresholds for cancer risk established by EPA and are similar to urban areas in the United States.

---
---

**Question:** Explain the role of aldehydes in winter ozone formation.

**Answer:** During cold winter months, the atmosphere holds less water vapor, and the main source of radicals for ozone formation is curtailed. Instead, radical production is dominated by the photolysis of aldehydes in the atmosphere.

---
---

**Question:** Summarize the findings of the 2013 Uinta Basin Winter Ozone Study.

**Answer:** The 2013 Uinta Basin Winter Ozone Study was a collaborative effort by a number of research groups to conduct intensive measurement campaigns during a winter with intense inversion conditions and high ozone concentrations. The data from this study has been used to evaluate the performance of photochemical models.

---
---

**Question:** What is the FOG inventory, and how is it used?

**Answer:** The Fuel-based Oil and Gas (FOG) inventory is a nation-wide inventory of methane and NOx emissions from the oil and gas industry.

---
---

**Question:** Describe the difference between primary and secondary formation of formaldehyde.

**Answer:** Primary formation of formaldehyde is when it is emitted directly from a source. Secondary formation is when it is formed from chemical reactions in the atmosphere.

---
---

**Question:** How would a lack of snow cover, even with a strong thermal inversion and precursor emissions, affect winter ozone production?

**Answer:** Without snow cover, the ground would absorb more solar radiation, which would warm the surface and likely weaken or prevent the formation of a strong thermal inversion. A weaker inversion would lead to more dispersion of pollutants, and less ozone formation.

---
---

**Question:** What are the specific chemical differences between emissions from the oil and gas industry and typical urban sources that lead to winter ozone?

**Answer:** Emissions from the oil and gas industry are rich in light alkanes (like propane, butane, and pentane), which are less reactive than the aromatic compounds more common in urban pollution. However, the sheer volume of these alkanes makes them a major contributor to ozone formation in the Uinta Basin.

---
---

**Question:** If the oil and gas industry in the Wind River Basin grows, what is the likelihood that it will start to experience winter ozone events?

**Answer:** If the oil and gas industry in the Wind River Basin grows, it is likely that it will start to experience winter ozone events, as it already has the other two necessary ingredients: thermal inversions and snow cover.

---
---

**Question:** Can you explain the concept of a 'heavy-tailed' distribution in the context of inversion cluster size?

**Answer:** A heavy-tailed distribution means that extreme events are more likely than in a normal distribution. In the context of inversion cluster size, it means that while the average inversion may last for a certain number of days, there is a non-trivial chance of having a very long inversion event (e.g., 41-46 days).

---
---

**Question:** What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a tethersonde to measure inversion strength?

**Answer:** A tethersonde is a weather balloon that is tethered to the ground and can be used to collect data at different altitudes. The advantage is that it can provide a detailed vertical profile of the atmosphere. The disadvantage is that it can only be used in one location at a time and may not be representative of the entire basin.

---
---

**Question:** How might climate change, with its potential to impact snow cover and temperature, affect the frequency and severity of winter ozone events in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** Climate change could lead to less snow cover in the Uinta Basin, which would likely reduce the frequency and severity of winter ozone events. However, it could also lead to more stable atmospheric conditions, which could favor the formation of inversions.

---
---

**Question:** What are the challenges of accurately modeling the horizontal structure of an inversion?

**Answer:** The horizontal structure of an inversion can be very complex, with different depths and strengths in different parts of the basin. This makes it difficult to model accurately with a limited number of measurement sites.

---
---

**Question:** Explain the methodology behind the aircraft-based mass balance technique for estimating methane emissions.

**Answer:** The aircraft-based mass balance technique involves flying an aircraft around the perimeter of a basin and measuring the concentration of a pollutant at different altitudes. By knowing the wind speed and direction, scientists can calculate the total amount of the pollutant that is being emitted from the basin.

---
---

**Question:** Why is there such a large discrepancy between the methane emissions estimates from different studies?

**Answer:** There are many reasons for the discrepancy in methane emissions estimates, including the use of different measurement techniques, different study periods, and different assumptions about the sources of emissions.

---
---

**Question:** What is the 'geostatistical inverse modeling framework,' and how is it used to estimate emissions?

**Answer:** The geostatistical inverse modeling framework is a technique that uses measurements of a pollutant at a number of different locations to estimate the location and strength of the sources of that pollutant.

---
---

**Question:** How does the TROPOMI satellite measure methane emissions from space?

**Answer:** The TROPOMI satellite has an instrument that can measure the concentration of methane in the atmosphere. By taking measurements over a period of time, scientists can create a map of methane concentrations and identify the sources of emissions.

---
---

**Question:** What are the limitations of using satellite data to estimate emissions?

**Answer:** The limitations of using satellite data to estimate emissions include the fact that the satellite can only measure the total amount of a pollutant in a column of air, and it cannot distinguish between sources that are close together. Cloud cover can also be a problem.

---
---

**Question:** If the 2017 Utah Division of Air Quality's oil and gas inventory is roughly accurate for total non-methane organics emissions, but inaccurate for individual source types, what are the implications for air quality modeling?

**Answer:** If the inventory is inaccurate for individual source types, it will be difficult to develop effective control strategies. For example, if the inventory overestimates emissions from one source and underestimates emissions from another, a control strategy that targets the wrong source will not be effective.

---
---

**Question:** Why is it important to distinguish between primary and secondary formation of formaldehyde?

**Answer:** It is important to distinguish between primary and secondary formation of formaldehyde because it helps us understand the sources of this important ozone precursor. If most of the formaldehyde is being formed secondarily, then we need to focus on controlling the emissions of the precursors to formaldehyde, rather than just the direct emissions of formaldehyde.

---
---

**Question:** What is the FOG inventory, and how does it differ from other emissions inventories?

**Answer:** The FOG inventory is a fuel-based inventory, which means that it estimates emissions based on the amount of fuel that is consumed. This is different from other inventories, which may be based on direct measurements of emissions or on estimates of activity data.

---
---

**Question:** What are the main reasons for the decline in methane emissions in the Uinta Basin from 2013 to 2021?

**Answer:** The main reasons for the decline in methane emissions in the Uinta Basin from 2013 to 2021 are a strong decline in natural gas production in the eastern Basin, and improvements to industry operations that have decreased emissions.

---
---

**Question:** How can improvements to industry operations lead to a decrease in emissions?

**Answer:** Improvements to industry operations can include things like replacing old equipment with newer, more efficient equipment, implementing leak detection and repair programs, and using vapor recovery units to capture emissions from storage tanks.

---
---

**Question:** Why do methane and non-methane organics emissions tend to track changes in gas production, but not oil production?

**Answer:** Methane and non-methane organics emissions tend to track changes in gas production, but not oil production, because natural gas is a major source of both methane and non-methane organics. Oil production, on the other hand, is a smaller source of these pollutants.

---
---

**Question:** What is a 'multiple linear regression model,' and how can it be used to predict methane emissions?

**Answer:** A multiple linear regression model is a statistical model that uses a number of different independent variables to predict a dependent variable. In this case, it is used to predict methane emissions based on oil and gas production, active well count, and new well count.

---
---

**Question:** Why are emissions of organics more likely to be detectable at new, high-producing oil and gas wells?

**Answer:** Emissions of organics are more likely to be detectable at new, high-producing oil and gas wells because these wells have higher production rates and are more likely to have leaks.

---
---

**Question:** What are the challenges of using optical gas imaging cameras in cold weather?

**Answer:** Optical gas imaging cameras work by detecting the infrared radiation that is absorbed by organic gases. In cold weather, the performance of these cameras can be degraded because there is less of a temperature difference between the gas and the background.

---
---

**Question:** How do glycol dehydrators contribute to emissions of reactive aromatics?

**Answer:** Glycol dehydrators are used to remove water from natural gas. They can be a source of reactive aromatics because the glycol can absorb these compounds from the gas and then release them to the atmosphere.

---
---

**Question:** What are the environmental risks associated with land farms for oil and gas solid waste disposal?

**Answer:** The environmental risks associated with land farms for oil and gas solid waste disposal include the potential for emissions of non-methane organics, which can contribute to ozone formation.

---
---

**Question:** Why are methane emissions per well pad in the Uinta Basin among the highest in the country?

**Answer:** Methane emissions per well pad in the Uinta Basin are among the highest in the country because of the high number of low-producing wells. These wells are often older and have less effective emissions controls.

---
---

**Question:** What is the significance of the fact that methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are consistently about 6-8% of methane production?

**Answer:** The fact that methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are consistently about 6-8% of methane production is significant because it is a very high leakage rate. This means that a large amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is being released to the atmosphere.

---
---

**Question:** What are the implications of the fact that the majority of methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are from sources that are too low to be detected by aerial measurement technologies?

**Answer:** The fact that the majority of methane emissions in the Uinta Basin are from sources that are too low to be detected by aerial measurement technologies means that it is very difficult to get an accurate inventory of methane emissions. It also means that it is difficult to target control strategies effectively.

---
---

**Question:** What are the environmental and economic implications of the fact that marginal wells are responsible for a large percentage of methane emissions?

**Answer:** The environmental and economic implications of the fact that marginal wells are responsible for a large percentage of methane emissions are that these wells are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they produce very little oil and gas. This means that there is a strong economic incentive to plug these wells and reduce their emissions.

---
---

**Question:** How does the practice of running pumpjack engines 'extremely lean' impact air quality?

**Answer:** The practice of running pumpjack engines “extremely lean” impacts air quality because it leads to less NOx formation, but more incomplete combustion. This means that there are higher emissions of organic compounds, which can contribute to ozone formation.

---
---

**Question:** What are the challenges of accurately modeling emissions from produced water ponds?

**Answer:** The challenges of accurately modeling emissions from produced water ponds include the fact that the composition of the water can vary widely, and the emissions can be affected by a number of different factors, such as temperature and wind speed.

---
---

**Question:** Why is it important to understand the composition of organic compound emissions from produced water?

**Answer:** It is important to understand the composition of organic compound emissions from produced water because these emissions are more reactive than typical oil and gas emissions and are responsible for a significant portion of locally-produced ozone.

---
---

**Question:** What are the main challenges of measuring emissions from subsurface leaks?

**Answer:** The main challenges of measuring emissions from subsurface leaks are that these leaks can be very small and difficult to detect, and the emissions can be very variable.

---
---

**Question:** How can emissions from liquid storage tanks be controlled?

**Answer:** Emissions from liquid storage tanks can be controlled by using vapor recovery units to capture the emissions and by implementing leak detection and repair programs.

---
---

**Question:** Why do well pads with emissions control devices sometimes have higher detectable emissions from tanks than wells without control devices?

**Answer:** Well pads with emissions control devices sometimes have higher detectable emissions from tanks than wells without control devices because the control devices can create back pressure, which can force emissions to escape from other parts of the tank, such as thief hatches and pressure relief valves.

---
---

**Question:** What is the relationship between the gas-to-oil ratio of a well and its emissions?

**Answer:** The gas-to-oil ratio of a well is the ratio of the amount of gas that is produced to the amount of oil that is produced. This ratio can affect the emissions from a well because it can affect the amount of gas that is vented or flared.

---
---

**Question:** How does the Bonanza power plant impact air quality in the Uinta Basin during winter inversions?

**Answer:** The Bonanza power plant is a large source of NOx, but during wintertime inversions, the plume’s exit velocity and buoyancy relative to the surrounding air propel the majority of the plume above the inversion layer, so its influence on wintertime ozone production under the inversion is small.

---
---

**Question:** What is the role of nitrous acid (HONO) in atmospheric chemistry?

**Answer:** Nitrous acid (HONO) is a source of OH radicals, which are important for the formation of ozone. However, HONO photolysis is not a major source of radicals in the Uinta Basin.

---
---

**Question:** Why do NOx measurement systems at regulatory monitoring stations become contaminated during winter inversions?

**Answer:** NOx measurement systems at regulatory monitoring stations can become contaminated with other reactive nitrogen compounds during winter inversions, which can lead to a high bias in the measurements.

---
---

**Question:** What is the significance of the fact that most nitric acid formation during inversions occurs from nighttime chemistry?

**Answer:** The fact that most nitric acid formation during inversions occurs from nighttime chemistry is significant because it means that the lifetime of NOx is shorter at night. This can affect the formation of ozone during the day.

---
---

**Question:** How does nitrogen deposition impact lichen communities in the Uinta Mountains?

**Answer:** Nitrogen deposition can impact lichen communities by providing them with a source of nitrogen, which can allow them to grow in areas where they would not otherwise be able to. However, too much nitrogen can be harmful to lichens.

---
---

**Question:** What are the main challenges of accurately simulating winter ozone formation with photochemical models?

**Answer:** The main challenges of accurately simulating winter ozone formation with photochemical models are the difficulty of accurately simulating the meteorology of winter inversions and the difficulty of accurately representing the emissions of ozone precursors.

---
---

**Question:** How would you design a study to determine the relative importance of meteorological conditions versus emissions inventories in the accuracy of photochemical models?

**Answer:** To determine the relative importance of meteorological conditions versus emissions inventories in the accuracy of photochemical models, you could design a study in which you run the model with different meteorological inputs and different emissions inventories and compare the results to observations.

---
---

**Question:** What are the pros and cons of using different chemical mechanisms (e.g., CB6 vs. RACM2) in photochemical models?

**Answer:** The pros of using a more complex chemical mechanism like CB6 or RACM2 are that they can provide a more accurate representation of the chemistry of ozone formation. The cons are that they can be more computationally expensive and may require more detailed emissions inventories.

---
---

**Question:** How could you use a regression model to predict the impact of a new oil and gas well on local air quality?

**Answer:** You could use a regression model to predict the impact of a new oil and gas well on local air quality by including the well as a new source of emissions in the model and then running the model to see how it affects the predicted ozone concentrations.

---
---

**Question:** What are the limitations of using hospital admissions data to study the health impacts of air pollution?

**Answer:** The limitations of using hospital admissions data to study the health impacts of air pollution are that it can be difficult to control for confounding factors, such as other triggers of asthma attacks, and the data may not be representative of the entire population.

---
---

**Question:** How would you design a study to investigate the long-term health impacts of living in the Uinta Basin?

**Answer:** To investigate the long-term health impacts of living in the Uinta Basin, you could design a cohort study in which you follow a group of people over a period of time and collect data on their health and their exposure to air pollution.

---
---

**Question:** If you were a molecule of ozone in the Uinta Basin, what would your life be like?

**Answer:** As a molecule of ozone in the Uinta Basin, my life would be short and chaotic. I would be born from the reaction of NOx and VOCs in the presence of sunlight, and I would spend my days oxidizing other molecules and contributing to the formation of photochemical smog. I would likely be destroyed by a reaction with another molecule or by being deposited on a surface.

---
---

**Question:** Write a haiku about winter inversions.

**Answer:** Cold air sits below,
Sunlight reflects off the snow,
Ozone starts to grow.

---
---

**Question:** What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow in the Uinta Basin during a winter inversion?

**Answer:** An unladen swallow in the Uinta Basin during a winter inversion would have an airspeed velocity that is dependent on whether it is a European or African swallow. However, given the cold temperatures, it is unlikely that a swallow would be flying in the Uinta Basin during a winter inversion.

---
---

**Question:** If we could build a giant fan to blow away the inversion, would that solve the ozone problem? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Building a giant fan to blow away the inversion would likely not solve the ozone problem. While it might temporarily disperse the pollutants, the inversion would likely reform as soon as the fan was turned off. A more effective solution would be to reduce the emissions of ozone precursors.

---
---

**Question:** Can you explain the chemistry of winter ozone formation to a 5-year-old?

**Answer:** Imagine that the air is like a big bowl of soup. When it gets cold, a lid forms on top of the bowl, and all the stinky stuff gets trapped inside. The sun then cooks the stinky stuff and turns it into something even stinkier, called ozone.
